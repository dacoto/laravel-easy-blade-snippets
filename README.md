# Laravel Easy Blade Snippets

Laravel blade snippets for Visual Studio Code

## Usage
The included snippets are organized in categories following Laravel's Facades and their documentation; such as `Auth::`, `Config::` and `Session::`.

All the snippets in this package follow the following naming convention : `{category}::{function name}`. For example : `Auth::check` will produce this snippet in your code : `Auth::check()`.
